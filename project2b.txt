1. A and B is only susceptible to "surreptitious forwarding". 
If Person X sends a message to Person Y, Person Y may decrypt the message
and re-encrypt the message with Person Z's public key and have it sent to
Person Z. Person Z will now think that this message was meant for him/her
and was sent by Person X. This can be easily ELIMINATED by prepending the
name of the recipient in the message, so A and B are SECURE and neither is 
the answer to the question.

For C, an intruder can intercept a message and sign E with his own private
(signing) key and swap the signature from the message with his own signature
and then have it sent instead.
He can then claim authorship/take credit of the message that is sent.
This is a serious security threat because if Person X and Y are users but only
Person X has the root password, Person Y may intercept the login message sent
by Person X and replace the signature with his own and have it sent instead
and now the server may grant full server access to Person Y instead

Therefore, OPTION C has a serious security problem and so it is my answer.



2. Compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data.
It is generally done by recognising and taking advantage of repetitions or
any patterns. When you encrypt a message, you usually get a shorter and very
random hash. Therefore its pointless to compress then as there would be no
patterns in it, so there wouldn't be much of a size reduction after
compression. So it's best to compress first and then encrypt in so that 
compression can work most effectively.



3. I am assuming that only one key can be tested at a time since information
regarding this is not given.

a. 128-bit key permuations = 2^(128)
Time taken to decrypt a sentence with all permuations = 2^(128) * 10^(-16)s
Number of seconds in a year =  365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31536000
It would take (2^(128) * 10^(-6))/31536000 years i.e. 1.0790283e+25 years

a) 1.0790283e+25 years

b. 256-bit key permuations = 2^(128)
It would take (2^(256) * 10^(-6))/31536000 years i.e. 3.6717431e+63 years

b) 3.6717431e+63 years

c. Milliseconds in a day = 24 * 60 * 60 * 10^(3) =  86400000
It would take (86400000 * 10^(-6)) seconds i.e 86.4 seconds

c) 86.4 seconds

d. Milliseconds in a millenium = 1000 *24 * 365 * 60 * 60 *10^(3) 
                               = 31536000000000
It would take (31536000000000 * 10^(-6))/31536000 = 1 year

d) 1 year
